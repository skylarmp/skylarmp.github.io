	<p> Hello, my name is Skylar Palmer. Welcome to PTPT. I am a Doctor of Physical Therapy. I recieved my degree from the University of Saint Augustine Health Sciences in 2016. For several years I worked at the Orthopedic Center of Montana, and then as a travel PT in a variety of settings. I started PTPT to work along side my father Dr. Shane Palmer, DC and serve the greater Wilmington community. From bed side in the hospital, to sidelines on the field, I have always practiced with a guding principle: be kind, be patient, work hard and help others grow strong. Thus our mission statement-"Be kind. Grow strong".</p>
